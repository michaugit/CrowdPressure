In order to execute the simulation program without IDE:

1. Run cmd in folder where CrowdPressureAGH.jar is placed,
2. Run "java -jar CrowdPressureAGH.jar" in cmd.
3. Enjoy yourself a working application :)

The application weren't exported to exe file because application is writing some significant information about the simulation in real time in terminal, so we decided to share this informations, that everybody can see it.
